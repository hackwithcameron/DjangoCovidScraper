# DjangoCovidScraper

I created a web scraper using pythons requests library and Beautifulsoup, and decided to take it a little further by turning it into a local web application. By doing this I can create a better layout and display the information in a more readable format. The web scraper itself can be found [here](https://github.com/hackwithcameron/DjangoCovidScraper/blob/master/COVIDPage/scripts/COVIDCrawler/covidCrawler.py) for this web application specifically.
